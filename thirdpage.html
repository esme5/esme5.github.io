            <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Charles Darwin 1809-1882</a></h3>
            <p>
              "Charles Robert Darwin was an English naturalist and geologist, best known for his 
              contributions to evolutionary theory. He established that all species of life have 
              descended over time from common ancestors, and in a joint publication with Alfred 
              Russel Wallace introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of 
              evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the 
              struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved 
              in selective breeding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book 
              On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of 
              transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and much of the 
              general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing 
              explanations and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis 
              from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural 
              selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. In modified form, Darwin's 
              scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the 
              diversity of life."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Wikipedia</a>

          <h3>The Origin of Species</h3>
          <article class="more">
          <p>
            "In mid-December [of 1836, shortly after his voyage on The Beagle], Darwin took lodgings 
            in Cambridge to organise work on his collections and rewrite his Journal. He wrote 
            his first paper, showing that the South American landmass was slowly rising, and with 
            Lyell's enthusiastic backing read it to the Geological Society of London on 4 January 
            1837. On the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the Zoological 
            Society. The ornithologist John Gould soon announced that the Galapagos birds that 
            Darwin had thought a mixture of blackbirds, "gros-beaks" and finches, were, in fact, 
            twelve separate species of finches. On 17 February, Darwin was elected to the Council
            of the Geological Society, and Lyell's presidential address presented Owen's findings 
            on Darwin's fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his 
            uniformitarian ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
Early in March, Darwin moved to London to be near this work, joining Lyell's social circle of 
scientists and experts such as Charles Babbage, who described God as a programmer of laws. Darwin 
stayed with his freethinking brother Erasmus, part of this Whig circle and a close friend of the
writer Harriet Martineau, who promoted Malthusianism underlying the controversial Whig Poor Law 
reforms to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a Unitarian, she welcomed
the radical implications of transmutation of species, promoted by Grant and younger surgeons
influenced by Geoffroy. Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order, but 
reputable scientists openly discussed the subject and there was wide interest in John Herschel's
letter praising Lyell's approach as a way to find a natural cause of the origin of new species.
          </p>
          <p>
Gould met Darwin and told him that the Galápagos mockingbirds from different islands were separate
species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a "wren" was also in the finch group.
Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the Beagle, 
including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands. The two rheas were also distinct species,
and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.
          </p>
          <p>
By mid-March, Darwin was speculating in his Red Notebook on the possibility that "one species 
does change into another" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as 
the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange Macrauchenia, which resembled a giant guanaco.
His thoughts on lifespan, asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction developed in his "B"
notebook around mid-July on to variation in offspring "to adapt & alter the race to changing
world" explaining the Galápagos tortoises, mockingbirds and rheas. He sketched branching descent,
then a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, in which "It is absurd to talk of
one animal being higher than another", discarding Lamarck's independent lineages progressing to
higher forms."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Wikipedia</a>
          </p>
          <h3>Health Problems</h3>
          <p>"For much of his adult life, Charles Darwin's health was repeatedly compromised by an
          uncommon combination of symptoms, leaving him severely debilitated for long periods of 
          time. However, in some ways this may have helped his work, and Charles Darwin wrote
          "Even ill-health, though it has annihilated several years of my life, has saved me from 
          the distractions of society and amusement."
          </p>
          <p>
He consulted numerous doctors, but, with the medical science of the time, the cause remained 
undiagnosed. He tried all available treatments, but, at best, they had only temporary success.
More recently, there has been much speculation as to the nature of his illness.
          </p>
          <p>
For over forty years Darwin suffered intermittently from various combinations of symptoms such
as: malaise, vertigo, dizziness, muscle spasms and tremors, vomiting, cramps and colics, 
bloating and nocturnal intestinal gas, headaches, alterations of vision, severe tiredness, 
nervous exhaustion, dyspnea, skin problems such as blisters all over the scalp and eczema, 
crying, anxiety, sensation of impending death and loss of consciousness, fainting, tachycardia, 
insomnia, tinnitus, and depression. These symptoms displayed by Darwin may have been diagnosed
today as a form of dysautonomia known as Hyperadrenergic Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia 
Syndrome, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome or Orthostatic intolerance."

              <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel">Gregor Mendel 1822-1884</a></h3>
              <p>
                "Gregor Johann Mendel was a German-speaking Moravian-Silesian scientist and Augustinian
                friar and abbot of St. Thomas' Abbey in Brno who gained posthumous fame as the founder
                of the modern science of genetics. Though farmers had known for centuries that 
                crossbreeding of animals and plants could favor certain desirable traits, Mendel's
                pea plant experiments conducted between 1856 and 1863 established many of the rules of
                heredity, now referred to as the laws of Mendelian inheritance.
              </p>
              <p>
Mendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants: plant height, pod shape and color, seed
shape and color, and flower position and color. With seed color, he showed that when a yellow pea
and a green pea were bred together their offspring plant was always yellow. However, in the next
generation of plants, the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1:3. To explain this phenomenon, 
Mendel coined the terms “recessive” and “dominant” in reference to certain traits. (In the
preceding example, green peas are recessive and yellow peas are dominant.) He published his
work in 1866, demonstrating the actions of invisible “factors”—now called genes—in providing for
visible traits in predictable ways.
              </p>
              <p>
The profound significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th century 
(more than three decades later) with the independent rediscovery of these laws. Erich von 
Tschermak, Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and William Jasper Spillman independently verified severa
l of Mendel's experimental findings, ushering in the modern age of genetics."
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel">Wikipedia</a>

          </div>
          <h3>Mendel's Laws of Inheritance</h3>
          <p>
            "Mendel discovered that, when he crossed purebred white flower and purple flower pea
            plants (the parental or P generation), the result was not a blend. Rather than being
            a mix of the two, the offspring (known as the F1 generation) was purple-flowered.
            When Mendel self-fertilized the F1 generation pea plants, he obtained a purple flower
            to white flower ratio in the F2 generation of 3 to 1. The results of this cross are 
            tabulated in the Punnett square to the right.
          </p>
          <p>
He then conceived the idea of heredity units, which he called "factors". Mendel found that
there are alternative forms of factors—now called genes—that account for variations in inherited 
characteristics. For example, the gene for flower color in pea plants exists in two forms, one 
for purple and the other for white. The alternative "forms" are now called alleles. For each 
biological trait, an organism inherits two alleles, one from each parent. These alleles may be
the same or different. An organism that has two identical alleles for a gene is said to be 
homozygous for that gene (and is called a homozygote). An organism that has two different
alleles for a gene is said be heterozygous for that gene (and is called a heterozygote).
          </p>
          <p>
Mendel also hypothesized that allele pairs separate randomly, or segregate, from each other
during the production of gametes: egg and sperm. Because allele pairs separate during gamete
production, a sperm or egg carries only one allele for each inherited trait. When sperm and
egg unite at fertilization, each contributes its allele, restoring the paired condition in the 
offspring. This is called the Law of Segregation. Mendel also found that each pair of alleles
segregates independently of the other pairs of alleles during gamete formation. This is known
as the Law of Independent Assortment.
          </p>
          <p>
The genotype of an individual is made up of the many alleles it possesses. An individual's
physical appearance, or phenotype, is determined by its alleles as well as by its environment. 
The presence of an allele does not mean that the trait will be expressed in the individual that
possesses it. If the two alleles of an inherited pair differ (the heterozygous condition),
then one determines the organism’s appearance and is called the dominant allele; the other has
no noticeable effect on the organism’s appearance and is called the recessive allele. Thus, in 
the example above dominant purple flower allele will hide the phenotypic effects of the recessive
white flower allele. This is known as the Law of Dominance but it is not a transmission law, 
dominance has to do with the expression of the genotype and not its transmission. The upper case 
letters are used to represent dominant alleles whereas the lowercase letters are used to 
represent recessive alleles."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel">Wikipedia</a>

              <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Chargaff">Erwin Chargaff 1905-2002</a></h3>
              <p>
                "Erwin Chargaff was an Austro-Hungarian biochemist who immigrated to the United States
                during the Nazi era and was a professor of biochemistry at Columbia University medical
                school.[1] Through careful experimentation, Chargaff discovered two rules that helped
                lead to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA."
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Chargaff#Chargaff.27s_rules">Wikipedia</a>
              </p>
              <h3>Chargaff's Rules</h3>
              <p>
                Erwin Chargaff may have proposed two main rules in his lifetime which were
                apparently appropriately named Chargaff's rules. The first and best known 
                achievement was to show that in natural DNA the number of guanine units equals
                the number of cytosine units and the number of adenine units equals the number
                of thymine units. In human DNA, for example, the four bases are present in these 
                percentages: A=30.9% and T=29.4%; G=19.9% and C=19.8%. This strongly hinted
                towards the base pair makeup of the DNA, although Chargaff did not explicitly
                state this connection himself. For this research, Chargaff is credited with 
                disproving the tetranucleotide hypothesis (Phoebus Levene's widely accepted 
                hypothesis that DNA was composed of a large number of repeats of GACT). Most
                researchers had previously assumed that deviations from equimolar base ratios
                (G = A = C = T) were due to experimental error, but Chargaff documented that the
                variation was real, with [C + G] typically being slightly less abundant. He was
                able to do this with the newly developed paper chromatography and ultraviolet 
                spectrophotometer. Chargaff met Francis Crick and James D. Watson at Cambridge 
                in 1952, and, despite not getting along with them personally, he explained his 
                findings to them. Chargaff's research would later help the Watson and Crick 
                laboratory team to deduce the double helical structure of DNA.
                </p>
                <p>
The second of Chargaff's rules is that the composition of DNA varies from one species to
another, in particular in the relative amounts of A, G, T, and C bases. Such evidence of
molecular diversity, which had been presumed absent from DNA, made DNA a more credible 
candidate for the genetic material than protein."

              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
           " After Francis Crick, James Watson and Maurice Wilkins received the 1962 Nobel Prize
            for their work on discovering the double helix of DNA, Chargaff withdrew from his
            lab and wrote to scientists all over the world about his exclusion."
