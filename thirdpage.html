            <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Charles Darwin 1809-1882</a></h3>
            <p>
              "Charles Robert Darwin was an English naturalist and geologist, best known for his 
              contributions to evolutionary theory. He established that all species of life have 
              descended over time from common ancestors, and in a joint publication with Alfred 
              Russel Wallace introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of 
              evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the 
              struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved 
              in selective breeding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book 
              On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of 
              transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and much of the 
              general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing 
              explanations and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis 
              from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural 
              selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. In modified form, Darwin's 
              scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the 
              diversity of life."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Wikipedia</a>

          <h3>The Origin of Species</h3>
          <article class="more">
          <p>
            "In mid-December [of 1836, shortly after his voyage on The Beagle], Darwin took lodgings 
            in Cambridge to organise work on his collections and rewrite his Journal. He wrote 
            his first paper, showing that the South American landmass was slowly rising, and with 
            Lyell's enthusiastic backing read it to the Geological Society of London on 4 January 
            1837. On the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the Zoological 
            Society. The ornithologist John Gould soon announced that the Galapagos birds that 
            Darwin had thought a mixture of blackbirds, "gros-beaks" and finches, were, in fact, 
            twelve separate species of finches. On 17 February, Darwin was elected to the Council
            of the Geological Society, and Lyell's presidential address presented Owen's findings 
            on Darwin's fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his 
            uniformitarian ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
Early in March, Darwin moved to London to be near this work, joining Lyell's social circle of 
scientists and experts such as Charles Babbage, who described God as a programmer of laws. Darwin 
stayed with his freethinking brother Erasmus, part of this Whig circle and a close friend of the
writer Harriet Martineau, who promoted Malthusianism underlying the controversial Whig Poor Law 
reforms to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a Unitarian, she welcomed
the radical implications of transmutation of species, promoted by Grant and younger surgeons
influenced by Geoffroy. Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order, but 
reputable scientists openly discussed the subject and there was wide interest in John Herschel's
letter praising Lyell's approach as a way to find a natural cause of the origin of new species.
          </p>
          <p>
Gould met Darwin and told him that the Galápagos mockingbirds from different islands were separate
species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a "wren" was also in the finch group.
Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the Beagle, 
including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands. The two rheas were also distinct species,
and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.
          </p>
          <p>
By mid-March, Darwin was speculating in his Red Notebook on the possibility that "one species 
does change into another" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as 
the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange Macrauchenia, which resembled a giant guanaco.
His thoughts on lifespan, asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction developed in his "B"
notebook around mid-July on to variation in offspring "to adapt & alter the race to changing
world" explaining the Galápagos tortoises, mockingbirds and rheas. He sketched branching descent,
then a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, in which "It is absurd to talk of
one animal being higher than another", discarding Lamarck's independent lineages progressing to
higher forms."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Wikipedia</a>
          </p>
          <h3>Health Problems</h3>
          <p>"For much of his adult life, Charles Darwin's health was repeatedly compromised by an
          uncommon combination of symptoms, leaving him severely debilitated for long periods of 
          time. However, in some ways this may have helped his work, and Charles Darwin wrote
          "Even ill-health, though it has annihilated several years of my life, has saved me from 
          the distractions of society and amusement."
          </p>
          <p>
He consulted numerous doctors, but, with the medical science of the time, the cause remained 
undiagnosed. He tried all available treatments, but, at best, they had only temporary success.
More recently, there has been much speculation as to the nature of his illness.
          </p>
          <p>
For over forty years Darwin suffered intermittently from various combinations of symptoms such
as: malaise, vertigo, dizziness, muscle spasms and tremors, vomiting, cramps and colics, 
bloating and nocturnal intestinal gas, headaches, alterations of vision, severe tiredness, 
nervous exhaustion, dyspnea, skin problems such as blisters all over the scalp and eczema, 
crying, anxiety, sensation of impending death and loss of consciousness, fainting, tachycardia, 
insomnia, tinnitus, and depression. These symptoms displayed by Darwin may have been diagnosed
today as a form of dysautonomia known as Hyperadrenergic Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia 
Syndrome, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome or Orthostatic intolerance."

              <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel">Gregor Mendel 1822-1884</a></h3>
              <p>
                "Gregor Johann Mendel was a German-speaking Moravian-Silesian scientist and Augustinian
                friar and abbot of St. Thomas' Abbey in Brno who gained posthumous fame as the founder
                of the modern science of genetics. Though farmers had known for centuries that 
                crossbreeding of animals and plants could favor certain desirable traits, Mendel's
                pea plant experiments conducted between 1856 and 1863 established many of the rules of
                heredity, now referred to as the laws of Mendelian inheritance.
              </p>
              <p>
Mendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants: plant height, pod shape and color, seed
shape and color, and flower position and color. With seed color, he showed that when a yellow pea
and a green pea were bred together their offspring plant was always yellow. However, in the next
generation of plants, the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1:3. To explain this phenomenon, 
Mendel coined the terms “recessive” and “dominant” in reference to certain traits. (In the
preceding example, green peas are recessive and yellow peas are dominant.) He published his
work in 1866, demonstrating the actions of invisible “factors”—now called genes—in providing for
visible traits in predictable ways.
              </p>
              <p>
The profound significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th century 
(more than three decades later) with the independent rediscovery of these laws. Erich von 
Tschermak, Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and William Jasper Spillman independently verified severa
l of Mendel's experimental findings, ushering in the modern age of genetics."
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel">Wikipedia</a>
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h3>Mendel's Laws of Inheritance</h3>
          <p>
            "Mendel discovered that, when he crossed purebred white flower and purple flower pea
            plants (the parental or P generation), the result was not a blend. Rather than being
            a mix of the two, the offspring (known as the F1 generation) was purple-flowered.
            When Mendel self-fertilized the F1 generation pea plants, he obtained a purple flower
            to white flower ratio in the F2 generation of 3 to 1. The results of this cross are 
            tabulated in the Punnett square to the right.
          </p>
          <p>
He then conceived the idea of heredity units, which he called "factors". Mendel found that
there are alternative forms of factors—now called genes—that account for variations in inherited 
characteristics. For example, the gene for flower color in pea plants exists in two forms, one 
for purple and the other for white. The alternative "forms" are now called alleles. For each 
biological trait, an organism inherits two alleles, one from each parent. These alleles may be
the same or different. An organism that has two identical alleles for a gene is said to be 
homozygous for that gene (and is called a homozygote). An organism that has two different
alleles for a gene is said be heterozygous for that gene (and is called a heterozygote).
          </p>
          <p>
Mendel also hypothesized that allele pairs separate randomly, or segregate, from each other
during the production of gametes: egg and sperm. Because allele pairs separate during gamete
production, a sperm or egg carries only one allele for each inherited trait. When sperm and
egg unite at fertilization, each contributes its allele, restoring the paired condition in the 
offspring. This is called the Law of Segregation. Mendel also found that each pair of alleles
segregates independently of the other pairs of alleles during gamete formation. This is known
as the Law of Independent Assortment.
          </p>
          <p>
The genotype of an individual is made up of the many alleles it possesses. An individual's
physical appearance, or phenotype, is determined by its alleles as well as by its environment. 
The presence of an allele does not mean that the trait will be expressed in the individual that
possesses it. If the two alleles of an inherited pair differ (the heterozygous condition),
then one determines the organism’s appearance and is called the dominant allele; the other has
no noticeable effect on the organism’s appearance and is called the recessive allele. Thus, in 
the example above dominant purple flower allele will hide the phenotypic effects of the recessive
white flower allele. This is known as the Law of Dominance but it is not a transmission law, 
dominance has to do with the expression of the genotype and not its transmission. The upper case 
letters are used to represent dominant alleles whereas the lowercase letters are used to 
represent recessive alleles."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel">Wikipedia</a>

              <p>
                "Erwin Chargaff was an Austro-Hungarian biochemist who immigrated to the United States
                during the Nazi era and was a professor of biochemistry at Columbia University medical
                school.[1] Through careful experimentation, Chargaff discovered two rules that helped
                lead to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA."
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Chargaff#Chargaff.27s_rules">Wikipedia</a>
              </p>
              <h3>Chargaff's Rules</h3>
              <p>
                Erwin Chargaff may have proposed two main rules in his lifetime which were
                apparently appropriately named Chargaff's rules. The first and best known 
                achievement was to show that in natural DNA the number of guanine units equals
                the number of cytosine units and the number of adenine units equals the number
                of thymine units. In human DNA, for example, the four bases are present in these 
                percentages: A=30.9% and T=29.4%; G=19.9% and C=19.8%. This strongly hinted
                towards the base pair makeup of the DNA, although Chargaff did not explicitly
                state this connection himself. For this research, Chargaff is credited with 
                disproving the tetranucleotide hypothesis (Phoebus Levene's widely accepted 
                hypothesis that DNA was composed of a large number of repeats of GACT). Most
                researchers had previously assumed that deviations from equimolar base ratios
                (G = A = C = T) were due to experimental error, but Chargaff documented that the
                variation was real, with [C + G] typically being slightly less abundant. He was
                able to do this with the newly developed paper chromatography and ultraviolet 
                spectrophotometer. Chargaff met Francis Crick and James D. Watson at Cambridge 
                in 1952, and, despite not getting along with them personally, he explained his 
                findings to them. Chargaff's research would later help the Watson and Crick 
                laboratory team to deduce the double helical structure of DNA.
                </p>
                <p>
The second of Chargaff's rules is that the composition of DNA varies from one species to
another, in particular in the relative amounts of A, G, T, and C bases. Such evidence of
molecular diversity, which had been presumed absent from DNA, made DNA a more credible 
candidate for the genetic material than protein."

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
           " After Francis Crick, James Watson and Maurice Wilkins received the 1962 Nobel Prize
            for their work on discovering the double helix of DNA, Chargaff withdrew from his
            lab and wrote to scientists all over the world about his exclusion."

                "Alfred Day Hershey was an American Nobel Prize–winning bacteriologist and 
                geneticist. He was born in Owosso, Michigan and received his B.S. in chemistry
                at Michigan State University in 1930 and his Ph.D. in bacteriology in 1934, 
                taking a position shortly thereafter at the Department of Bacteriology at 
                Washington University in St. Louis. He began performing experiments with 
                bacteriophages with Italian-American Salvador Luria and German Max Delbrück 
                in 1940, and observed that when two different strains of bacteriophage have
                infected the same bacteria, the two viruses may exchange genetic information.
                He moved with his assistant Martha Chase to Cold Spring Harbor, New York, in 
                1950 to join the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Department of Genetics, 
                where he and Chase performed the famous Hershey–Chase experiment in 1952. This 
                experiment provided additional evidence that DNA, not protein, was the genetic
                material of life.
              <br></br>
He became director of the Carnegie Institution in 1962 and was awarded the Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine in 1969, shared with Salvador Luria and Max Delbrück for their discovery
on the replication of viruses and their genetic structure."

          <h3>The Hershey-Chase Experiment</h3>
          <p>
            The Hershey–Chase experiments were a series of experiments conducted in 1952 by
            Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase that helped to confirm that DNA is genetic material. 
            While DNA had been known to biologists since 1869, many scientists still assumed
            at the time that proteins carried the information for inheritance because DNA appeared
            simpler than proteins. In their experiments, Hershey and Chase showed that when 
            bacteriophages, which are composed of DNA and protein, infect bacteria, their DNA 
            enters the host bacterial cell, but most of their protein does not. Although the 
            results were not conclusive, and Hershey and Chase were cautious in their
            interpretation, previous, contemporaneous and subsequent discoveries all served to 
            prove that DNA is the hereditary material.
            <br></br>

Hershey shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Max Delbrück and Salvador 
Luria for their “discoveries concerning the genetic structure of viruses.”

              <p>
                "Rosalind Elsie Franklin was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer who made contributions 
                to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA 
                (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite. Although her works on coal and viruses
                were appreciated in her lifetime, her contributions to the discovery of DNA were largely 
                recognized posthumously.
                <br></br>
                Franklin is best known for her work on the X-ray diffraction images of DNA while at King's College,
                London, which led to the discovery of the DNA double helix for which James Watson, Francis Crick
                and Maurice Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. Watson suggested
                that Franklin would have ideally been awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with Wilkins, 
                but the Nobel Committee does not make posthumous nominations."

          <h3>Hints of DNA Structure</h3>
          <p>
            "Franklin, working with Gosling,[a Ph.D. student assigned to her] started to apply
            her expertise in X-ray diffraction techniques to the structure of DNA. She used a 
            new fine-focus X-ray tube and microcamera ordered by Wilkins, but which she refined, 
            adjusted and focused carefully. Drawing upon her physical chemistry background, she
            also skillfully manipulated the critical hydration of her specimens. When Wilkins
            inquired about this improved technique, she replied in terms which offended Wilkins
            as Franklin had "an air of cool superiority".
<br></br>
Franklin's habit of intensely looking people in the eye while being concise, impatient and direct
unnerved many of her colleagues. In stark contrast, Wilkins was very shy, and slowly calculating 
in speech while he avoided looking anyone directly in the eye. In spite of the intense
atmosphere, Franklin and Gosling discovered that there were two forms of DNA: at high humidity
(when wet), the DNA fibre became long and thin; when it was dried it became short and fat.
<br></br>
Franklin named these two forms "B" and "A" respectively. (The biological functions of A-DNA were
only discovered 60 years later.) Because of the intense personality conflict developing between
Franklin and Wilkins, Randall divided the work on DNA. Franklin chose the data rich "A" form
while Wilkins selected the "B" form because his preliminary pictures had hinted it might be
helical. He showed tremendous insight in this assessment of preliminary data. The X-ray
diffraction pictures taken by Franklin at this time have been called, by J. D. Bernal, as 
"amongst the most beautiful X-ray photographs of any substance ever taken".
<br></br>
By January 1953, Franklin had reconciled her conflicting data, concluding that both DNA forms 
had two helices, and had started to write a series of three draft manuscripts, two of which 
included a double helical DNA backbone. Her two A-DNA manuscripts reached Acta
Crystallographica in Copenhagen on 6 March 1953, one day before Crick and Watson had completed
their model on B-DNA.

              <p>
                Francis Harry Compton Crick was a British molecular biologist, biophysicist,
                and neuroscientist, most noted for being a co-discoverer of the structure of
                the DNA molecule in 1953 with James Watson. Together with Watson and Maurice
                Wilkins, he was jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
                "for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and 
                its significance for information transfer in living material".
<br></br>
Crick was an important theoretical molecular biologist and played a crucial role in research
related to revealing the genetic code. He is widely known for use of the term "central dogma"
to summarize the idea that genetic information flow in cells is essentially one-way, from DNA 
to RNA to protein."<a herf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick">Wikipedia</a>

                Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins was a New Zealand-born British physicist and molecular 
                biologist, and Nobel Laureate whose research contributed to the scientific understanding
                of phosphorescence, isotope separation, optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and 
                to the development of radar. He is best known for his work at King's College, London 
                on the structure of DNA which falls into three distinct phases.

          <h3>Trials & Errors</h3>
          <p>
            In mid-March 1953, using experimental data collected mainly by Rosalind Franklin
            (without her permission) and also by Maurice Wilkins, Watson and Crick deduced the 
            double helix structure of DNA.Sir Lawrence Bragg,the director of the Cavendish
            Laboratory (where Watson and Crick worked), made the original announcement of the 
            discovery at a Solvay conference on proteins in Belgium on April 8, 1953; it went
            unreported by the press. Watson and Crick submitted a paper to the scientific journal
            Nature, which was published on April 25, 1953.[44] This has been described by some
            other biologists and Nobel laureates as the most important scientific discovery 
            of the 20th century. Bragg gave a talk at the Guy's Hospital Medical School in
            London on Thursday, May 14, 1953, which resulted in a May 15, 1953, article by
            Ritchie Calder in the London newspaper News Chronicle, entitled "Why You Are You.
            Nearer Secret of Life."
<br></br>
Sydney Brenner, Jack Dunitz, Dorothy Hodgkin, Leslie Orgel, and Beryl M. Oughton were some 
of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of DNA, constructed by
Crick and Watson; at the time, they were working at Oxford University's Chemistry Department.
All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner, who subsequently worked with Crick
at Cambridge in the Cavendish Laboratory and the new Laboratory of Molecular Biology. According 
to the late Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Dorothy
Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of
DNA.
<br></br>

The Cambridge University student newspaper Varsity also ran its own short article on the
discovery on Saturday, May 30, 1953. Watson subsequently presented a paper on the double-
helical structure of DNA at the 18th Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Viruses in early June
1953, six weeks after the publication of the Watson and Crick paper in Nature. Many at the
meeting had not yet heard of the discovery. The 1953 Cold Harbor Symposium was the first 
opportunity for many to see the model of the DNA double helix.
<br></br>
Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962
for their research on the structure of nucleic acids. Rosalind Franklin had died in 1958 
and was therefore ineligible for nomination.
<br></br>
The publication of the double helix structure of DNA can be regarded as a turning point in
science: human understanding of life was fundamentally changed and the modern era of biology 
began. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watson">Wikipedia</a>
