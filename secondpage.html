          <p>So how exaclty does DNA send out instructions to the rest of the cell?</p>
          <p>The process is caleed gene expresiion and i tconsists of two main steps: translation 
          and transcription.</p>
          <p>during translation, information in DNA is opied in to another molecule, RNA, which then 
          takes this information from the nucleous to the protien factories called ribosomes.
          Here is where transcription occurs, converting the information in to long chains of amino 
          acids which then become folded in to proteins like hemoglobin.</p>
