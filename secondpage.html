          <h3>Replication</h3>
          <p>In molecular biology, DNA replication is the biological process of
          producing two identical replicas of DNA from one original DNA molecule.
          This process occurs in all living organisms and is the basis for
          biological inheritance. DNA is made up of a double helix of two strands,
          and each strand of the original DNA molecule serves as a template for the 
          production of the complementary strand, a process referred to as
          semiconservative replication. Cellular proofreading and error-checking
          mechanisms ensure near perfect fidelity for DNA replication.
<br></br>
In a cell, DNA replication begins at specific locations, or origins of replication,
in the genome. Unwinding of DNA at the origin and synthesis of new strands
results in replication forks growing bidirectional from the origin. A number of 
proteins are associated with the replication fork which helps in terms of the
initiation and continuation of DNA synthesis. Most prominently, DNA polymerase
synthesizes the new DNA by adding complementary nucleotides to the template strand.

          <h3>Replication Process</h3>
          <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span>Initiation</h5>
          <p>"For a cell to divide, it must first replicate its DNA. This process is initiated
          at particular points in the DNA, known as "origins", which are targeted by initiator
          proteins. Sequences used by initiator proteins tend to be "AT-rich" (rich in adenine
          and thymine bases), because A-T base pairs have two hydrogen bonds (rather than the
          three formed in a C-G pair) which are easier to unzip. Once the origin has been
          located, these initiators recruit other proteins and form the pre-replication
          complex, which unzips the double-stranded DNA."
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication">Wikipedia</a>
          </p>
          <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span>Elongation</h5>
          <p>"Once the two strands are separated, primase adds RNA primers to the template
          strands. The leading strand receives one RNA primer while the lagging strand 
          receives several. The leading strand is continuously extended from the primer by a 
          DNA polymerase with high processivity, while the lagging strand is extended
          discontinuously from each primer forming Okazaki fragments. RNase removes the
          primer RNA fragments, and a low processivity DNA polymerase distinct from the
          replicative polymerase enters to fill the gaps. When this is complete, a single
          nick on the leading strand and several nicks on the lagging strand can be found. 
          Ligase works to fill these nicks in, thus completing the newly replicated DNA
          molecule.
          <br></br>
          As DNA synthesis continues, the original DNA strands continue to unwind on each
          side of the bubble, forming a replication fork with two prongs."
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication">Wikipedia</a>
          </p>
          <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span>Termination</h5>
          <p>"Eukaryotes initiate DNA replication at multiple points in the chromosome,
          so replication forks meet and terminate at many points in the chromosome;
          these are not known to be regulated in any particular way. Because 
          eukaryotes have linear chromosomes, DNA replication is unable to reach the
          very end of the chromosomes, but ends at the telomere region of repetitive
          DNA close to the ends. This shortens the telomere of the daughter DNA
          strand. Shortening of the telomeres is a normal process in somatic cells. 
          As a result, cells can only divide a certain number of times before the DNA
          loss prevents further division. (This is known as the Hayflick limit.)
          Within the germ cell line, which passes DNA to the next generation, 
          telomerase extends the repetitive sequences of the telomere region to 
          prevent degradation. Telomerase can become mistakenly active in somatic
          cells, sometimes leading to cancer formation. Increased telomerase activity
          is one of the hallmarks of cancer.
<br></br>
Termination requires that the progress of the DNA replication fork must stop or be
blocked. Termination at a specific locus, when it occurs, involves the interaction
between two components: (1) a termination site sequence in the DNA, and (2) a
protein which binds to this sequence to physically stop DNA replication."

          <h5>So how exactly does DNA send out instructions to the rest of the cell?</h5>
          <p>The process is called gene expression and it consists of two main steps: translation 
          and transcription.</p>
          <p>During translation, information in DNA is copied in to another molecule, RNA, which then 
          takes this information from the nucleous to the protein factories called ribosomes. In the 
          picture on the left they are depicted as small red dots surrounding the pink Golgi apparatus.
         Transcription occurs here, converting the information in to long chains of amino 
          acids which then become folded into proteins like hemoglobin. This process happens 
          in every cell, but the proteins produced will differ sightly between cells of 
          different organs.</p>
