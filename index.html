          <h3>Purpose of DNA</h3>
          <p>DNA encodes all of the instructions our bodies require to keep us alive. When our bodies 
          were being formed, our DNA instructed all of our cells to become a heart, a leg, hair follicles.
          These instructions are encoded in the sequence of the DNA molecule. They eventually 
          become proteins, complex structures also built by small blocks. These blocks are called 
          amino acids. There are 20 different ones, each with different chemical characteristics 
          that influence how a protein looks, its 3-dimensional shape. This shape is critical to the 
          purpose of a protein, a deformation can lead to many diseases.</p>
          <p>Making a protein is a complicated process that occurs in all living beings daily. There are 
          many, many steps involved, and each one poses a risk of an error occuring. From the 
          initial copying of the instructions (transcription) to the making of the proteins 
          themselves (translation), as well as errors during meiosis (making new cells). We begin to 
          understand the complexities of preserving and distributing those instructions.</p>

          <p>DNA is located in the nucleus of cells. The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane, which also
          contributes to its regulation by restricting the movement of molecules in and out. In the picture on the left,
           the nucleus is white and the membrane is the light blue area surrounding it. (The purple 
           area is called the Golgi apparatus and has another function altogether.)</p>
           <p>The process of DNA replication occurs here.</p>

        <h3>Why DNA is ideal to carry genetic information</h3>
        <p>for almost 4 billions years DNA has been the carrier of genetic information. within that time
        there has been virtually no change to its structure. in that same time millions of new species
         have come and gone, eveolved much longer genmoes.</p>
         <p>This longetivity stems from the structure of the DNA molecule. it is xtremely stable, under 
         special conditions such as laco of oxygen, DNA can withstand very high and low temperatures, 
         estremes in pressure and humidity.</p>
