          <h3>Purpose of DNA</h3>
          <p>DNA encodes all of the instructions our bodies require to keep us alive. When our bodies 
          were being formed, our DNA instructed all of our cells to become a heart, a leg, hair follicles.
          These instructions are encoded in the sequence of the DNA molecule. They eventually 
          become proteins, complex structures also built by small blocks. These blocks are called 
          amino acids. There are 20 different ones, each with different chemical characteristics 
          that influence how a protein looks, its 3-dimensional shape. This shape is critical to the 
          purpose of a protein, a deformation can lead to many diseases.</p>
          <p>Making a protein is a complicated process that occurs in all living beings daily. There are 
          many, many steps involved, and each one poses a risk of an error occuring. From the 
          initial copying of the instructions (transcription) to the making of the proteins 
          themselves (translation), as well as errors during meiosis (making new cells). We begin to 
          understand the complexities of preserving and distributing those instructions.</p>

          <p>DNA is located in the nucleus of a cell. The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane, which also
          contributes to DNA regulation by restricting the movement of molecules. In the picture on the left,
           the nucleus is represented by the white area in the middle and the membrane is the light blue area
           surrounding it. (The purple area is called the Golgi apparatus and has another function altogether.)</p>
           <p>Many processes occur in the nucleus including replication and gene expression. 
           The DNA double helix is not easily accessible, it exists most commonly in the tightly
            coiled form of a chromosome. Other proteins must come in and unwind first the 
            larger chromosome and then the double helix, in order to access its instructions.</p>

          <p>The structure of DNA is paramount to its funtion. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Double helix: The structure that most easily catches the eye. it is composed
             of deoxyribose sugars linked by a phosphate group. If DNA were a ladder these sugars would the side rails. 
             They provide much of the stability of the molecule and protect the bases within the 
             helix which encode instructions. In the picture on the left, it is depicted as a blue ribbon
              with a pentagon attached.
             </li>
            <li>Nucleotides: The building blocks of the molecule, they consist of the phospate group,
             the deoxyribose sugar, and the nitrogenous base. Stacked one on top of the other, 
             the order of the bases dictates the proteins that will be made.</li>
            <li>Nitrogenous Bases: Come in four varieties, Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine. 
            Cytosine only bonds with Guanine and Adenine with Thymine, this is due to the fact that 
            their 3-dimensional shapes fit together like puzzle pieces. The bonds between the bases are what 
            keep the rungs of the ladder together and lend more stability to the structure. 
            Every three bases, called codons, code for an amino acid. the graph on the right reveals which 
            amino acids correspond to which codon. Notice different codons might result in the same 
            amino acid.</li>

        <h3>Why is DNA ideal to carry genetic information?</h3>
        <p>For almost 4 billion years DNA has been the universal carrier of genetic information. Within that time
        its structure has remained virtually unchanged. It has retained its double helical nature, with four 
        bases coding the genes critical to survival. However, in that same time period, we've seen many 
        new species of increasing complexity evolve, needing ever longer genomes to preserve instructions 
        for the next generation.</p>
         <p>This longetivity stems from the structure of the DNA molecule. It is extremely stable under 
         normal conditions, with the sugar-phosphate backgound acting as a protective barrier and the 
         bonds between the nitrogen bases stabilizng the helix even more. During special conditions such as 
          lack of oxygen, DNA can withstand very high and low temperatures, and extremes in pressure and 
        humidity. With advancing technology, it is now possible to extract and examine the DNA of fossils 
        species and sequence their genome.</p>
